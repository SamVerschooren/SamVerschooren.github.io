Hi, welcome to my academic website. Browse the tabs above to find out more about my research and teaching.

I’m currently a Marie Skłodowska-Curie fellow at the Arctic University of Norway in Tromsø (NO), working with Prof. Dr. <a href="https://uit.no/research/cognitive-neuroscience">Matthias Mittner</a> to investigate transitions between different attentional and distraction states. Before moving to Norway, I was a postdoctoral research fellow (funded by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation) working at the Humboldt University of Berlin (DE) and the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences (DE) with Prof. Drs. <a href="https://social-intelligence-group.github.io/">Marcel Brass</a> and <a href="https://www.cbs.mpg.de/departments/neurology/mind-body-emotion">Michael Gaebler</a>. During this time, I worked on interoceptive attention and on voluntary control over internal bodily functions, such as heart rate and skin temperature. Before that, I weas a postdoctoral research fellow at Ghent University (BE) working with Prof. Drs. Marcel Brass and <a href="https://users.ugent.be/~sbraem/">Senne Braem</a> (funded by FWO) and at Duke University (USA) working with Prof. Dr. <a href="https://www.egnerlab.org/">Tobias Egner</a> (funded by BAEF), where I examined the balance between external and internal attention. I'm also broadly interested in the integration of perspective on the human mind from cognitive science and contemplative traditions (more info on an ongoing collaboration with an international yoga institute <a href="https://www.yogalife.org/research-collaboration">here</a>).

I did my PhD at Ghent University, where I investigated how people switch between external and internal attention, under the supervision of Prof. Dr. <a href="https://www.cap-lab.be/">Gilles Pourtois</a>. Prior to my PhD, I obtained master’s degrees in theoretical and experimental psychology and in philosophy.

In my free time, I love reading books and going for hikes and camping in the mountains. I’m also a big music fan, particularly of Bob Dylan. I go running and climbing often, and practice yoga and meditation.
