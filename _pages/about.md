Hi, welcome to my academic website. Browse the tabs above to find out more about my research, teaching, and background.

I’m currently a Marie Skłodowska-Curie postdoctoral fellow at the Arctic University of Norway in Tromsø (NO), working with Prof. Dr. <a href="https://uit.no/research/cognitive-neuroscience">Matthias Mittner</a> to investigate transitions between different attentional and distraction states. You can find my CV <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/files/CV.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

When I'm not in the office, I mostly like to spend my time hiking, camping, climbing, or skiing in the mountains, but I can also also enjoy relaxing at home with a book. I really enjoy listening to folk and blues music. I even attempted to learn to play the harmonica for a while, but that was only mildly successful.
