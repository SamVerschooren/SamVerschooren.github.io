I have gained international research experience in several labs around the world. Before moving to Norway, I was a postdoctoral research fellow (funded by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation) working at the Humboldt University of Berlin (DE) and the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences (DE) with <a href="https://social-intelligence-group.github.io/">Marcel Brass</a> and <a href="https://www.cbs.mpg.de/departments/neurology/mind-body-emotion">Michael Gaebler</a>. During this time, I worked on interoceptive attention and on voluntary control over internal bodily functions, such as heart rate and skin temperature. Before that, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at Ghent University (BE) working with Marcel Brass and <a href="https://users.ugent.be/~sbraem/">Senne Braem</a> (funded by FWO) and at Duke University (USA) working with <a href="https://www.egnerlab.org/">Tobias Egner</a> (funded by BAEF), where I examined the balance between external and internal attention. I'm also broadly interested in the integration of perspective on the human mind from cognitive science and contemplative traditions (more info on an ongoing collaboration with an international yoga institute <a href="https://www.yogalife.org/research-collaboration">here</a>).

I completed my PhD at Ghent University (2020), where I investigated how people switch between external and internal attention, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cap-lab.be/">Gilles Pourtois</a>. Prior to my PhD, I obtained master’s degrees in theoretical and experimental psychology (2016) and in philosophy (2014).
