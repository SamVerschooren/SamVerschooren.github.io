Together with collaborators at Humboldt University and the MPI for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, we have recently published open-source pipelines aimed at streamlining and standardizing the analysis of peripheral physiological data – mainly cardiovascular activity (electrocardiography (ECG) and photoplethysmography (PPG)) and respiration – in relation to brain and behavioral data. If you want to try out our pipelines, find them <a href="https://martager.github.io/bbsig/">here</a>.

Please don't hesitate to contact me (sam.verschooren@uit.no) for a copy of one of my publications if you can't find it online.
